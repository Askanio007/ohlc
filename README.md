# Ohlc charts data

Memory: -Xms1500MB -Xmx2000MB

I think, it will be required to configure GC for big load, but I can't reproduce big load on my computer and can't to choose some strategy 

So, I decide to add task execution, although I assume that the application will be able to withstand the load without it. Need test :)
